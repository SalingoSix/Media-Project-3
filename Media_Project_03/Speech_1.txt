In early spring the air around Inkopolis is oft filled with the fluttering blossoms of early blooming sakura,
and the tiny parachute webs of millions of Pearls.
It is from simple beginnings that the young Pearlings find themselves soaring above the clouds,
ready to seek their fortune as street level free stylers who spit mad rhymes.
Mere weeks prior each hatched en mass in a grand exodus from one of the many children littering the various night life concert halls of the city.
Nurtured at first only by the neck meat in which their mother's ovipositor had injected them each would swarm forth in an aerosol of viscera phat beats and screams.
Although life begins for a Pearl as a nightmarish swarm of microbial parasites it is above the city skyline that each first truly becomes aware of the majesty of its own newfound life Before the seagulls discover the swarm of course.
For any that survive long enough to create their first mix tape there awaits the potential for fame fortune and eye nectar they so desperately crave.
The oppressive black clouds of spring Pearlings are a tradition in Inkopolis One that shall never be escaped.
