Project by Alex Medos

Program should run in x86 Debug mode

Can only play one stream at a time, and can not record voice while streaming

When saving the .wav file as instructed, it saves within the project folder, so the code behaves accordingly.

Controls:

1, 2, 3 - Switch between streaming stations. Press the same button to pause and play the active stream

4 - Begin and pause recording

5, 6, 7 - Toggles DSP effects for recorded voice

Space - Plays the first speech. All other sounds and controls are locked until this finishes playing

Enter - Begins playing the second speech from the .wav file

8, 9, 0 - Toggles DSP effects for the second speech

Esc - Exits
